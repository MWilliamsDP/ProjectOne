**ProjectOne: NYC Airbnb Data Analysis**

We started with thinking about exploring Airbnb data generally.  We decided NYC would give us a full enough set of data to work with for this project.  We settled on 4 main questions and mainly managed one per person with collaboration throughout.
**
We thought that this would provide a varied amount of data and also overlay nicely with a google maps exploration.  The initial data was already well organized, the only initial clean up on the main dataframe was eliminating $0 prices.**
-------------------------------------------------

1. Do the surrounding amenities make a difference in the popularity of a particular property? Is there a particular type that stands out, for example restaurants?

2. Are any boroughs/neighborhoods more popular consistently/does the time of year make a difference?

3. Is there a relationship between the minimum number of nights and the borough/neighborhood?

4. Is there a relationship between the number of properties listed by a host and the price?
