Project One: NYC Airbnb Data Analysis

We started with thinking about exploring Airbnb data generally.  We decided NYC would give us a full enough set of data to work with for this project.  We settled on 4 main questions and mainly managed one per person with collaboration throughout.

We thought that this would provide a varied amount of data and also overlay nicely with a google maps exploration.  The initial data was already well organized, the only clean up on the main dataframe was eliminating $0 prices.

Data was used from: Google's Places Api, and NYC Airbnb Data Csv.
-------------------------------------------------

1. Do the surrounding amenities make a difference in the popularity/or price of a particular property? Is there a particular type that stands out, for example restaurants?

2. Are any boroughs/neighborhoods more popular consistently/does the time of year make a difference?

3. Is there a relationship between the minimum number of nights and the borough/neighborhood?
